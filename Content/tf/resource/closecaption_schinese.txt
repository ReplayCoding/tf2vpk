"#commentary\tf2-Comment001.mp3"	"[Jeremy Stone] 在多人游戏中，玩家们大部分的活动内容都与其他玩家有关。 为了对这方面进行增强，我们专门设计了一些功能来明确玩家间的关系。 例如，当玩家被击杀时，会出现杀人者的定格画面，能帮助玩家记住特定的、麻烦的对手。 复仇者功能也会对玩家进行而外的提醒，以表明某些敌人比其他的更为重要。 玩家如果复仇杀死了对方，就会获得额外的分数，这样就在游戏中产生出一个小的负反馈循环效果。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment001.mp3"	"[Jeremy Stone] In multiplayer games, the content players consume is largely generated by other players.  To enhance this, we added features designed to promote relationships between players.  
For example, the freeze-cam shot of a player's killer helps the player remember specific, troublesome opponents.  The nemesis feature adds an additional reminder that certain enemies are more significant than others.  It creates a small negative reinforcement loop by giving players an opportunity to score extra points with a revenge kill.

"#commentary\tf2-Comment002.mp3"	"[Laura Dubuk] 地图都需要无法通行的边界，但除非我们将游戏环境限制在室内空间或陡峭的峡谷，否则那些边界是无法阻止玩家看到外围的、无法到达的区域。 在我们的一些较为真实的游戏中，例如半条命2，这些边界通常需要进行虚构和视觉的说明。 但是，在极具风格的《军团要塞2》世界中，明显的人为设计成为了我们的核心设计原则，因此我们可以简化或完全忽略这些解释，但又不影响玩家的体验。 例如，通过游戏测试发现，这些连接着空旷地区的低矮围栏，成功传达了一种信息：那就是栅栏以外的区域没什么意思，并且无法进入。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment002.mp3"	"[Laura Dubuk] Maps require impassable boundaries, but unless we restrict the environments to either interior spaces or steep canyons, these boundaries can't always block the player's view of the outlying, unreachable area. In our more realistic titles, like HL2, these boundaries often require fictional and visual explanations. In the heavily stylized Team Fortress world, however, conspicuous artificiality is a core design principle and so we can simplify or altogether ignore these explanations without compromising the player experience. Playtesting showed, for instance, that these low fences leading to an empty expanse successfully conveyed the message that the area beyond the fence is uninteresting and out-of-bounds."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment003.mp3"	"[Ariel Diaz] 《军团要塞2》中的每个兵种都经过专门设计，各自都具有独特的攻击和防守技能，而至于控制点，从根本上说，是一种让玩家注重那些重要的攻击与防守活动的方式。 控制点还能将玩家引领到地图上其他不同的地点。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment003.mp3"	"[Ariel Diaz] Each of the Team Fortress classes was designed to make a unique contribution to attack and defense, and control points are, fundamentally, methods of focusing players' attention on these core offensive and defensive activities. They're also useful for drawing players to different points of the map."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment004.mp3"	"[Jeff Lane] 在我们原来的设计中，一旦进攻方离开控制点，他们就会失去当前占领控制点的所有进度。 游戏测试表明，当玩家独自靠近敌方控制点并发现该区域有敌人时，他们就不会尝试去占领控制点。 此外，一旦某个团队只剩一个控制点来进行防守时，实力稍强的进攻方团队往往也无法成功占领最后一个控制点以完成全面占领状态，这使得许多游戏陷入了僵局。 因此，我们更改了占领方式，即使进攻方离开了控制点，其原有的占领进度也会保留一段时间，这样便同时解决了原来设计存在的两个问题。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment004.mp3"	"[Jeff Lane] In our original design, once attackers were cleared off a point, they lost any progress they'd made toward capturing the point. Playtests revealed that lone players near an enemy control point had no incentive to try to capture it if any enemies were in the area. Furthermore, once a team was reduced to defending a single control point, the stronger attacking team was often unable to successfully assault the final point for the full capture period, which caused too many games to end in a stalemate. We changed the capture mechanic so that capture progress persists for a while even after the attackers are cleared off the point, and this improvement fixed both of the problems with the original design.

"#commentary\tf2-Comment005.mp3"	"[Jim Hughes] 为了让玩家享受有趣的导航决策过程，必须根据玩家目前的兵种和地图状态，让地图的路线有效变化。 由于游泳的速度比跑步慢，水路会让我们为走特定路线付出更大的代价。 Spy 通常愿意付出这样的代价，因为这样才能隐秘潜入敌方。 Pyro 会避免付出这样的代价，因为他们在水下将无法使用主要武器。 如果敌方的防守稳固，任何兵种要从后方绕道攻击，走水路就很值得考虑。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment005.mp3"	"[Jim Hughes] To give players interesting navigation decisions, routes through a map should vary in effectiveness based on the player's current class and the state of the map. Water lets us increase the cost of taking a particular route, because swimming is slower than running. Spies often accept that cost in order to infiltrate undetected. Pyros avoid it because their primary weapon is useless underwater. If the enemy has a strong defense, the increased cost of the water route becomes a worthwhile tradeoff for any class trying to hit the defenders from behind."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment006.mp3"	"[Iikka Keranen] 为了减少广阔天空需要的内存，我们以 1/16 的比率构建了 3D 天顶空间。 也就是说，当火车在天顶空间和玩家间移动时，我们需要一点小技巧才能处理这样的画面。 其实每次火车移动都有两种版本；一个是实际玩家比例，用于实际的游戏空间，而另一个极小的版本则是用于天顶空间。 中间建筑每一侧的修理棚刚好可以掩饰我们在两辆火车间交换的位置。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment006.mp3"	"[Iikka Keranen] We build our 3d skyboxes at 1/16th scale to reduce the memory used by the large spaces in them. This means we have to get a little tricky when dealing with trains moving between the skybox and the player space. There are actually two versions of each moving train; A player-scaled one for the actual gameplay space, and a tiny one out in the skybox. The small repair sheds on either side of the middle building disguise the point at which we swap between the two trains."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment007.mp3"	"[Andrea Wicklund] 在理想状况下，每回合结束时，应该分别有一队赢家和输家。 而僵局基本上就是指两队都失败了。 为了避免出现僵局，我们的地图设计中融入了两个关键的变量：队伍重生时间以及从重生点到前线的路程时间。 占上风的队伍，其重生的时间会更快，并且重生点也会向前推进，这样能制造正面的反馈循环效果，增加他们推进的机会，并赢得胜利。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment007.mp3"	"[Andrea Wicklund] Ideally, matches should end in a victory for one team and a loss for the other. Stalemates are essentially a loss for both teams. To avoid stalemates, our map design considers two key variables: team respawn times and travel time from the respawn point to the frontline. The team that's winning gets slightly faster respawn times and more forward respawn points, a positive reinforcement loop that increases the chances for them to push forward and win the game."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment008.mp3"	"[Dave RIller] 为了配合 Sniper 这个兵种，地图中需要有开阔的空间、较长的视野以及能提掩护的地点。 而 Sniper 的目标需要另一条路线，以便绕过 Sniper 的视线，虽然这通常要付出额外代价，例如行进的时间会变长。 这样能让玩家做出选择：他们要选择直接但危险的行进路线，还是选择安全但缓慢的行进路线？ 在地图的另一边，通常会有与 Sniper 此时位置相对的敌方狙击平台，让 Sniper 可以彼此对抗，掩护位于暴露区域的队友。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment008.mp3"	"[Dave Riller] To accommodate snipers, maps need wide open spaces, long sightlines, and protective cover.  Targets of the Sniper require alternate routes that bypass the Sniper's sightlines, though these usually have an additional cost, such as increased travel time.  This leaves players with a choice:  do they take the more direct, but hazardous route, or the safer yet slower route?  Sniper positions generally also have a corresponding enemy sniper deck, positioned on the other side of the arena, which allows one sniper to counter another, offering cover for teammates in exposed areas."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment009.mp3"	"[Bay Raitt] 僵局通常出现在门口周围，因为双方队伍在门口两侧通常会安排较强的防御兵力。 为了打破这种情况，我们设计了其他的行进路线，但行进时间必然会拉长，通常只有敌方在主要地段布下重兵时，这种路线才比较有吸引力。 进入敌方据点的入口数量是地图设计的关键，因为当敌人从多路进攻时，很难守住一个区域。 这让单向出口成为了有用的设计工具，因为这能让我们将敌方入口点的数量与友方防守路线的数量分开。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment009.mp3"	"[Bay Raitt] Stalemates generally occur around doors, where teams have a strong defensive presence on either side of the opening. To help counter this, we provide alternate routes with high travel costs that become more attractive only when the enemy has strong defenses behind the main route. The number of enemy entry points into an area is crucial to its design, since it's extremely hard to hold an area when enemies approach from multiple fronts. This makes one way exits a useful design tool, since they let us uncouple the number of enemy entry points from the number of friendly offensive routes."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment010.mp3"	"[Jamaal Bradley] 为了游戏平衡性的目的，我们有时候需要抑制兵种的速度。 比如说，那些控制中央大门的定时器就是为了确保所有兵种可以在行动真正开始之前，抵达地图中段。 游戏测试表明，让队伍以小组方式等待大门开启，这样会更有乐趣。 玩家对战斗的期待加上疾驰的火车，让中间的控制点极具冲突气氛。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment010.mp3"	"[Jamaal Bradley] For gameplay purposes, we sometimes need to neutralize the speeds of the classes. For instance, these central door timers were created to ensure that all classes could make it to the middle part of the map by the time the action actually starts. Playtesting showed that it was more fun to have the teams waiting as a group as soon as the doors open. The anticipation of battle, combined with the hazardous moving trains, creates a great opening clash for the middle control point."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment011.mp3"	"[Matt Boone] 作为一种实用设计工具，防弹玻璃位于重兵把守的区域，例如控制点附近。 这让进攻方有机会看到敌方的防守兵力和步哨枪的位置，同时也让防守方能清楚看见敌人的集合情况。 这样的设计通常对防守方很重要，例如进攻方正在等待医生补充无敌能量。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment011.mp3"	"[Matt Boone] Bulletproof glass is a useful design tool in strongly defended areas, such as around control points. It gives the offensive team a chance to see enemy defenders and sentrygun positions, while affording the defensive team a good view of the gathering attackers. This is often crucial for the defense if the offense is waiting for a Medic's invulnerability charge."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment012.mp3"	"[Matthew Russell] 在攻/守地图上，僵局通常是因为攻方的队伍配置不佳，导致他们只能眼睁睁看着定时器的时间流逝。 为了避免出现这种情况，我们会设法让可能失败的状况像滚雪球一样迅速真正成为败局。 游戏一开始的时间很短，但只要攻方成功占领一个控制点，时间就会增加一点。 这样一个回合可以尽快结束，让游戏过程充满高度紧张。 回合的时间太长就无法产生我们想要创造的紧迫感。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment012.mp3"	"[Matthew Russell] On Attack/Defend maps, stalemates generally involve a weakly positioned attacking team beating its head against the wall as the timer bleeds out. To avoid this, we encourage likely losses to snowball into actual losses as quickly as possible. We start with a short time limit, and then add time whenever the offensive team succeeds in capturing a point. This way the round plays out in as short a time as possible and keeps the tension high throughout. Long round times aren't conducive to the sense of urgency we want to create."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment013.mp3"	"[John Cook] 设计可防御的建筑时，高度是一项有用的特征。 例如，控制点 B 的建筑需要防守方从各个方位防守。 建筑的高度加上四周的窗户，能给予建筑中的防守方优势，尤其是从建筑内部发射火箭及榴弹。 某些窗户使用了防弹玻璃，让他们可以安全地看到正在接近的敌人。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment013.mp3"	"[John Cook] Height is a useful feature when designing defensible buildings. For instance, the Cap B building needs to be defended from all directions. The height, and windows on all sides, give defenders in this building an advantage, when launching rockets & grenades from within. Bulletproof glass in some windows lets them safely view approaching enemies."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment014.mp3"	"[Jake Nicholson ] 针对士兵，我们在设计空间的高度时特别注意。士兵通常要居高临下向对手射击，这样才能发挥火箭扩散伤害的最大效果。 这里的屋顶让他们能有这种优势。 而屋顶的高度只有士兵利用火箭跳跃才上得来，其他兵种通常无法爬上屋顶。 因为使用火箭跳跃时必须承受火箭的伤害，因此士兵必须牺牲一些生命值才能换取空间高度的优势。 这样的折衷手段，以及在屋顶上缺乏治疗品，让我们可以保持这项强大优势，同时又不会破坏地图平衡，因为士兵需要依赖下面的医生才能保持他们的生命值。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment014.mp3"	"[Jake Nicholson ] For Soldiers, we design spaces with specific attention to height. Soldiers generally want to be shooting down at opponents to maximize the effect of their rockets' splash damage. The rooftop here gives them that advantage. It can also only be reached with the soldier's rocket jump, making it generally inaccessible to the other classes. Because of the splash damage from a rocket jump, soldiers have to trade health for the height advantage. This tradeoff, coupled with the lack of health on the roof, lets usmake the rooftop a powerful advantage without unbalancing the map, since soldiers will need to rely on medics down below to keep them healthy."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment015.mp3"	"[Dave Riller] 为了配合侦察兵兵种，地图需要开放空间，让侦察兵能沿着其他兵种无法前进的路线进行双重跳跃。这一区域有各式各样的屋顶和岩石，侦察兵 在穿越时不会遇到任何非侦察兵的对手。侦察兵通常能利用他们的速度优势撤退并恢复生命值。因此，我们在这里将治疗品放在封闭的小区域，让他们必须牺牲某种程度的移动自由，强迫他们承担一些风险。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment015.mp3"	"[Dave Riller] To accommodate the scout class, maps need open spaces that allow scouts to double jump along paths that the other classes can't navigate.  This area features a variety of rooftops and rocks that a scout can traverse while staying above any non-scout opponents.  Scouts often use their speed advantage to retreat and collect health, so here we force them to adopt some risk by placing the health inside a small, enclosed area, where they sacrifice some freedom of movement."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment016.mp3"	"[Matt Boone] 间谍是专为想要智取对手的玩家而设计。 如果水平够高，他可以在游戏中渗透进敌方队伍，在伪装下伺机行动，用他的背刺技立即杀掉敌人，尤其是狙击手、工程师及医生。 他的隐形能力则是为了在两种关键情况中提供帮助。 第一种是穿越前线；前线的玩家们通常会非常警觉，并且很容易对行进方向不对劲的“队友”产生怀疑。 第二种情况是从敌方区域逃离，尤其是在敌人势力范围内被识破伪装时。 他的电子工兵能轻松解决无人看管的敌方步哨枪，使得敌方工程师必须守好他们的建筑。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment016.mp3"	"[Matt Boone] The Spy is designed for players who want to outsmart their opponents. At a high level, his gameplay flow is to infiltrate the enemy team, move around while disguised, and use his instant-kill backstab to take out key enemies, usually snipers, engineers, and medics. His invisibility cloak is designed to help him in two key situations. The first is in getting past the frontline, where players are most vigilant against enemies and most suspicious of friends not heading in the right direction. The second is in escaping from enemies who have seen through his disguise while he's in enemy territory. His sapper was designed to allow him to easily take out unattended enemy sentryguns, forcing enemy engineers to keep a close eye on their buildings."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment017.mp3"	"[Eric Kirchmer] 平衡工程师由人工智能控制的步哨枪的优势，是《Team Fortress 2》中略显困难的设计问题之一。 如果步哨枪的威力太大，只有实力最强的玩家才能对付步哨枪。 如果步哨枪的威力太弱，工程师就没有机会对抗技实力强大的玩家，这样就让工程师完全找不到首先建造步哨枪的理由。 为此，我们让步哨枪只能有两种反应方式：对于不找掩护的对手，步哨枪可以发挥致命威力，但是如果敌人以掩护方式突然出现，步哨枪则无法聪明地对付敌人。 这样使得工程师必须使用他们的次要武器技能，弥补步哨枪的死角弱点，如果敌人试图硬冲过步哨枪，那么步哨枪将是难以逾越的屏障。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment017.mp3"	"[Eric Kirchmer] Balancing the strength of the Engineer's AI-controlled sentrygun was one of more difficult design problems in Team Fortress 2. If the gun was too powerful, only the most skilled players would be able to counteract it. If the gun was too weak, the Engineer would have no chance against skilled players, effectively eliminating any reason to build it in the first place. Our solution was to make the sentrygun essentially binary in the sense that it's lethal to opponents who don't take cover, but can't intelligently deal with enemies popping in and out of cover. This forces the Engineer to use his own secondary weapons skill to compensate for the sentrygun's corner weakness, while still making the sentrygun a formidable obstacle for any opponent simply attempting to sprint past it."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment018.mp3"	"[Andrew Burke] 侦察兵的设计目的是让玩家能快速移动，同时追踪目标。其他战斗兵种依靠的是强大的杀伤力，但侦察兵则依仗高速移动以及双重跳跃的能力，从而避开敌人火力。侦察兵的战斗风格大多都是根据主要武器——猎枪设计而成。猎枪能造成大量伤害，但其较大的散布范围使得侦察兵必须接近敌人才能发挥全部威力，而这样自己受伤的风险也很高。猎枪的攻击速率很慢，因此侦察兵必须暂时停住才能开火，接着闪躲，然后又暂停，重复这样的动作，敌人在停顿间有很大的机会可以打中他。 最后，猎枪弹匣小，装弹时间长，这是为了让侦察兵脱离战斗才能新装子弹，侦察兵可以利用速度优势轻松完成这项操作，但也让受伤的敌人有机会在侦察兵回来之前逃走。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment018.mp3"	"[Andrew Burke] The Scout is designed for players who are able to rapidly move around while tracking their target. Where other combat classes rely on high amounts of damage, the Scout relies on his high movement speed and double jump ability to dodge enemy fire. Much of his combat style is crafted through the features of his primary weapon, the scattergun. It does a large amount of damage, but has a wide spread that forces him to get close to the enemy for full effect, where he's also at highest risk of being hurt. It has a slow rate of fire that encourages him to pause to fire, then dodge, then pause, and so on, which gives enemies a higher chance to hit him at intervals. Finally, it holds a small clip and a slow reload time to encourage the Scout to pull out of combat to reload, something which he can do easily with his speed, and gives injured enemies a chance to run before the Scout returns."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment019.mp3"	"[Dhabih Eng] 士兵是核心战斗兵种，具备多种移动能力，以及优秀的远距离杀伤力。 他几乎能在任何战况下如鱼得水，而且是远距离反步哨枪的最佳兵种。 他的主要弱点是由于主要武器火箭发射器。 火箭发射器的弹匣小，这让士兵必须谨慎控制弹药量，并且由于发射的是速度相对较慢的发射弹，如果在短射程内遇到动作敏捷的敌人，比如侦察兵，那么火箭发射器就几乎没有用武之地。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment019.mp3"	"[Dhabih Eng] The Soldier is a core combat class featuring versatile movement and terrific long range damage capability. He's designed to be comfortable in almost any combat situation, and to be the best long-range anti-sentrygun class. His main weaknesses are designed into his primary weapon, the rocket launcher. It has a small clip size, which forces the Soldier to carefully manage his reloads, and it fires relatively slow-moving projectiles, making it ineffectual beyond short range against any opponent who dodges well, like the Scout."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment020.mp3"	"[Charlie Brown] 狙击枪是另一个伤脑筋的设计问题。 为了符合玩家期待，狙击枪必须能够在单发击中头部时杀掉对手。 另一方面，我们要确保狙击枪击中敌人臀部时不会造成同样严重的伤害，否则只要是经验老道的玩家拿着狙击枪，狙击枪就会变成游戏中最致命的短程武器，这会让 Sniper 完全没有了主要弱点。 为了解决这个问题，我们采用了攻击伤害计量器，这只会在 Sniper 将画面拉近时才会出现。 这个方法有几项有利的副作用： 
在不拉近画面或刚拉近画面时开枪的伤害低，能确保 Sniper 无法临时轻松开火就杀死敌人。 攻击时间表示 Sniper 可以快速造成低伤害，或以缓慢的间隔时间发出高伤害火力，这让对手在同时快攻时可以压制 Sniper。 如果 Sniper 在计时结束前开火就能造成高伤害，这是对狙击行为的奖励，例如位于相当好的优势位置，充分准备后猎杀敌人。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment020.mp3"	"[Charlie Brown] The sniper rifle was another tricky design problem. To meet players' expectations, a sniper rifle has to be able to kill an opponent with a single shot to the head. On the flip side, we need to ensure it can't be snap fired from the hip with the same effect, because then, in the hands of an experienced player, it also becomes the game's most lethal short range weapon, negating the Sniper's primary weakness. To solve this, we implemented a charging damage meter that only appears when the sniper is zoomed. This solution has several beneficial side effects: 
The low damage both while un-zoomed and at the initial zoom ensures that Snipers can't kill opponents with impromptu snap fire. The charge time means Snipers can deal out low damage shots quickly or highly damaging shots at slow intervals, which allows opponents to overwhelm them with a coordinated rush. The high damage at the end of the charge rewards Sniper-esque behaviors, such as locating a decent vantage point and taking very deliberate shots.

"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment021.mp3"	"[Marc Scaparro] The Pyro is designed to be the best short-range combat class, aimed at encouraging players to adopt an ambush style of play. To achieve this, we made the Pyro vulnerable in the open, which forces players to seek out enclosed areas and doorways.

"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment024.mp3"	"[John Morello] The Medic is the main support class. Previous support classes we've designed had a variety of problems. They didn't require much skill, because they stayed back in defended areas, which also kept them out of the funnest parts of the game. Worst of all, this meant they weren't even terribly useful because they generally weren't near the players who most needed to be healed. We designed the Team Fortress 2 Medic to solve these problems, primarily by focusing on keeping them right in the thick of battle. Additionally, we designed the medigun to be as easy to use as possible, so that Medics can focus on survival while healing teammates. Virtually no aiming is required, which lets Medics concentrate on following their heal target, who has a huge incentive to keep his Medic benefactor safe."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment025.mp3"	"[Aaron Halifax] 我们设计医疗枪的主要目的是在医生和治疗目标间建立深厚关系。我们想知道，如果专注于建立两个玩家间的关系会是什么结果，而不仅仅是设法让大型队伍展开团队合作。医疗枪的设计能确保医生以及他的治疗目标意识到彼此的存在，关注他们的生命值和相互位置，同时谨慎制定战略。我们希望玩家利用技巧让自己成为有意义的治疗目标，这样医生才愿意找出并治疗有作战技术的目标。这将有助于构建我们希望看到的关系。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment025.mp3"	"[Aaron Halifax] Our main goal in designing the Medigun was to build a strong relationship between the Medic and his healing target.  We wanted to see what we would get if we focused on creating a tight loop between two players, instead of just thinking about getting the larger team to cooperate.  The Medigun's design ensures that the Medic and his target are extremely conscious of each other, watching their health and relative positions, and making tactical choices carefully.  We wanted there to be skill involved in being a good healing target, so that Medics would seek out and latch onto skilled targets.  This helps foster the relationship we were after."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment026.mp3"	"[Jakob Jungels] 无敌状态考虑进了多人游戏速度的因素，否则会让多人游戏的情绪起伏不如设计优秀的单人游戏。 进入无敌状态的医生和队友进攻会让玩家觉得很刺激。 这对防守方而言也是紧急时刻，因为他们必须抵抗住 10 秒，直到无敌状态结束。 当敌方队伍退缩但又拒绝离开基地时，无敌状态能帮助队伍推进防御僵局，从而加快游戏进度。 如果不是缺少防御的零散兵力，攻方就比较容易在没有干扰的情况下补充无敌状态的能量。 此外，无敌状态也是医生的得意目标，是作为他进行有效治疗后的奖励。 为了鼓励这种行为，医生治疗受重伤的队友时，重伤伤员获得的能量会比轻伤伤员多。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment026.mp3"	"[Jakob Jungels] Invulnerability adds an element of pacing to the multiplayer experience, which otherwise tends to have fewer emotional highs and lows than a well-crafted single player game.  When an invulnerable Medic & his friend come running in, it's an extreme high point for them.  It's also a rush for the defenders, who know they've just got to hold on for 10 seconds until invulnerability fades.  Invulnerability also sharpens pacing by helping a team push through a defensive stalemate, when the enemy team turtles up and refuses to come out of their base.  Without a lack of defensive skirmishers, it's easier for the offense to build up the invulnerability charge without interruption.  In addition, invulnerability is a great goal for the Medic and rewards him for being an effective healer.

Instead of producing a large number of maps, most of which would go un-played, we decided to try and build a single map with more innate replayability than any we'd built before.  With most multiplayer maps, you know what you'll be doing before the map has even finished loading.  In our case, we wanted a map where you couldn't predict even something as basic as your starting point, let alone what you would be doing when you got there.  Hydro therefore begins with a randomized starting state.  The emphasis on control of constantly shifting territories means the map rarely feels repetitive.  Meanwhile, the explicit round structure keeps teams focused, and provides regular highs and lows as the teams gain and lose territory."

This is only really of interest to those who are near the top.  With TF2 we decided that a better approach might be to compare stats to the player's previous successes, turning them from a worldwide comparative system into a personalized motivational one. The beginning player gets encouragement and acknowledgement that while they're not highly skilled yet, they're getting better all the time. The veterans get to see when they've managed to come close to their previous record, which encourages them beat that record.  The personal stat system also acts as a validation system. When a player feels like they've had a really good run, the stats system pops up and essentially says, 'You're right, that was a great run.'"

The differences between our player classes were hard to expose satisfactorily.  Weapons firing anything other than bullets were hard to visualize.  Our maps didn't make a lot of sense in the real world, where two opposing forces rarely build bases within fifty feet of one another.  In addition, the game wasn't visually distinct from our other products.  A stylized world had none of these problems:  Put the massive Heavy next to the pinstripe-suited Spy, and players understand both the numerical health differences between the classes and their very different gameplay styles.  The medic's healing beam was easily understood by playtesters when they saw the floating red plus symbols streaming into the target.

Team readability was addressed by adopting an overall color palette for each team, picking warm colors for Red and cool colors for Blu.  Class readability was addressed through the character's silhouette. Unique silhouette and animation shapes are more identifiable at far distances, and across a broader range of light levels, than any amount of other visual detail on the model. Finally, the weapon was highlighted through the textures. The areas of highest contrast, which attracts player's eyes, are all focused around the chest area of our character models, right where they hold their weapon.

"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment033.mp3"	"[Robin Walker] We first showed TF2 at E3 in 1999, and here we are in 2007. So what took us so long?  The short answer is that it took us this long to make something we were happy with.  The long answer requires a look at our development process.  At its core is the assumption that we don't really know ahead of time what will be fun.  We know what has been fun in the past.  But if we've got 3 ideas on the table, we can't say for sure which one will be the most fun.  So, we've focused on developing a repeatable process that will find out.  It's based on a cycle of constant iteration, where evaluation is done by watching as many people play the game as possible.  In developing TF2, we tried out many, many features-a few of which made it to the final product, but most of which were cut.  For example, our initial versions of TF2 were focused on trying to build a game around the concept of a commander, a single player who had a real-time-strategy view of the battlefield.  He was responsible for building structures and providing a unifying strategy for the team.  But there were significant design challenges involved.  For instance, how do we design the game such that the commander can have fun, and at same time ensure that the players down on the ground can have fun?  How do we ensure that the players & the commander value the output of the other?  How do we ensure that the game is still fun if you have a terrible commander, or conversely, if you're a great commander with a terrible team?  We spent many months working on these and other issues, and never reached a point where we were satisfied.  In addition, our game had become overly complex, due to our attempts to add a strategy layer deep enough to warrant the addition of the commander in the first place.  In the end, we made the hard decision to remove him from the game and moved on."

"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment035.mp3"	"[Adrian Finol] One of the main changes between Team Fortress Classic and Team Fortress 2 was the removal of thrown grenades. 
Most classes could carry a standard hand grenade along with a secondary grenade, tied more closely to the class.  Team Fortress 2's focus on unique class roles led us to notice that the standard hand grenade was a more powerful combat decider than some of the primary weapons.  This made the classes more similar in combat-not a desired effect.  In addition, when we looked at some of Team Fortress Classic's map stalemates, they often resulted from large amounts of grenade spam. Two cases were particularly problematic:  That of players throwing grenades repeatedly through doorways, hoping to kill any enemies who might be there, and players on the verge of death throwing all their grenades in rapid succession, hoping to get a kill after they die.  Removing standard hand grenades made the game more fun almost immediately, especially for new players who were often confused as to why they died, when a grenade went off at their feet. When we examined the class-specific grenades, we found similar problems.  Eliminating them from playtests gave us yet another boost in making the game more fun.  Once we'd decided on removal, we analyzed each class to see what capabilities might have been lost as a result of the decision.  In some cases we added other capabilities, where we felt a class had lost the ability to make some interesting decisions, related to its special grenade type.

"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment037.mp3"	"[Eric Smith] For Half-Life 2 we developed something called Response Rules, a system that lets us fine-tune the way characters speak lines of dialog in response to game events that are not completely predictable.  In Team Fortress 2, we extended Response Rules to the multiplayer environment for the first time.  The Response Rule system works by listing speech concepts in a simple text file; the game code then makes characters attempt to speak when the rules or conditions defined in the text file are met in the game. For instance, when a player reloads his weapon, this signals the Response Rule system that now would be an appropriate time to speak a line about reloading. The Response Rule system checks the state of the world, and matches it to a set of rules that determine the best line of dialog to use for that speech concept.  If the player's health is low, he may speak a different reloading line than if he is completely healthy.  He could play a special line if he has killed more than two enemies in the last 20 seconds, another set of lines if he's underwater, and so on.  Keeping dialog and rules in script files gives the game's writers the ability to add speech to the game without needing any code support.

Even the shortlist of essential information is intimidating, including map goals, the whereabouts of their friends, who's shooting them with what weapon, and so on.  We didn't have any way to make all of this information visual, so first we had to prioritize and come up with an essential list of things every player needed to know in order to just have fun.  Information they could learn by playing the game-such as map layout-was of secondary importance; but there was also information, such as the Medic's invulnerability charge, that would be completely invisible unless we exposed it.  We tried to avoid attaching 2D elements to the HUD as much as possible, since we wanted players to be looking at the 3D world we'd built rather than some abstract representation.  For example, players always see their own team's spies as a spy, but they need to know how the spy is disguised to the other team.  We tried a quick hack where we put an icon representing the spy's current disguise floating above his head.  The icon proved baffling to playtesters.   When we tackled the problem by putting cut-out paper masks on the spy, it not only fit the humorous style of the game, but it let players get all pertinent information directly from a quick look at the spy's model, thus keeping them focused on the characters and on the action of the game.

Here, we can see the Heavy as he appears in Team Fortress 2, using this type of shading style. Note the tight transition between the light and dark sides of the skin on his upper arm. Using a traditional shading model as seen here, the character lighting appears too soft and lacks the distinctive look seen in hand painted illustrations. Our shading model, however, captures the dramatic transition between light and dark and helps to define the unmistakable look of Team Fortress 2. Another facet of illustrative shading is the use of rim highlights to accentuate the silhouettes of characters. Without the rim lighting, the characters tend to blend into the scenery.

An in-game editor allows designers to edit the definitions of particle systems and immediately preview effects in the game itself.

To justify this, and play up our stylized Spy-tech fiction, we designed the weapons to look like customized pieces of hardware, personalized and modified by each character to suit his own ends. In keeping with the industrial theme of the game, we looked to 60's era product design principles for the primary weapons, then focused on musical instruments for secondary and melee weapons, thinking these would reinforce the connection between the secondary items and each character's personality."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment045.mp3"	"[Jim Hughes] 设计高水平的战斗区域时，我们试着避免过于复杂混乱的场面。  复杂的几何学设计会让玩家感到困惑，让他们难以追踪敌人，并对他们战斗时的移动和瞄准能力产生干扰。 当房间无法容纳在里面战斗的玩家人数时，通常会让战斗的混乱情况加剧。  在地图的最后区域，我们希望玩家能在取得决定性的胜利前，首先自由展开激烈的战斗。  为了实现这个目标，我们建立了开阔的空间，添加上几个入口，同时提供多种高度，让玩家能以多种方式进攻和防守。 我们没有采用电梯或梯子，而是采用了斜坡，因为这样玩家随时都能自由移动而不会受到限制。  根据游戏测试，我们大幅改变了房间的维度和入口的大小，这样能确保战斗区域可以容纳更多玩家。  "
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment045.mp3"	"[Jim Hughes] When designing areas for high levels of combat, we try to avoid complexity and chaos.  Complex geometry confuses players, making it hard for them to track enemies, and interfering with their movement and aiming during combat. The most chaotic combat tends to occur when the size of the room fails to support the number of players fighting in it.  In this final area of the map, we wanted a freeform battle to rage for some time before anyone could achieve a decisive victory.  To achieve this, we built a wide open area with several entrances, and gave players a variety of attack and defense options at various heights. Rather than depend on elevators and ladders, we relied on ramps, since these allow freedom of movement at all times instead of confining players.  Through playtesting we made many changes to the dimensions of the room, the size of cover elements, and the size of the entrances, thus ensuring the area could accommodate a battle of many players.

"#commentary\tf2-Comment046.mp3"	"[Aaron Barber] Hydro 不像 TF 中的地图有渐进的蓝色及红色侧边，例如 2fort 以及 Well，TF2 中的队伍能拥有 Hydro 的四个主要竞技场。 我们需要一个整体的主题，让一些结构合理化，例如岩墙及隧道，但是同时也要保持中性的色彩组合。 我们选择沙漠主题，搭配红棕色岩石、冷色调蓝天以及中性浅色系的独特色调，配合周围环境。 不同区域的色彩略有不同，但仍可以彼此搭配。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment046.mp3"	"[Aaron Barber] Unlike maps in TF such as 2fort and Well, which have progressively blue and red sides, Hydro's four main arenas can be owned by one team or the other. We needed an overall theme that justified structures like rock walls and tunnels, but which also had a neutral color scheme. We chose a desert theme with a palette of reddish-brown rock, cool blue sky and neutral light colors that complement the surrounding area. The colors of the seperate areas vary slightly but still key together.

"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment047.mp3"	"[Chet Faliszek] The announcer for Team Fortress 2, Ellen McLain, has the rare distinction of being the only voice actor to perform in all the products in the Orange box.  For her role in Team Fortress 2, we had Ellen try various reads on the same lines letting her ad-lib different personalities.  On the 5th try, she came up with the winner. Her disappointed and slightly angry evil overlord clearly lets you know, in the world of Team Fortress a tie does not mean everyone wins, but that everyone loses."
"#commentary\tf2-Comment048.mp3"	"[Laura Dubuk] 这个区域是个麻烦的问题。 因为竞技场主要是在室内，我们不能对基本结构进行大幅改动，因此我们着重于小心处理室内空间的形状，以便构建浮雕空间。 建筑本身是个方块，有大型的长方形窗户，与中央的圆形（发电机）形成对比。 为了制造深度和视差，我们添加了线性元素，例如轨道和电缆。 我们利用地板上的阴影以及光线的明暗对比，再加上走廊来建立有趣的明暗图样。 将这些元素结合在一起后，玩家的目光将被旗帜所吸引 — 而旗帜必须成为竞技场的焦点。"
"[english]#commentary\tf2-Comment048.mp3"	"[Laura Dubuk] This area presented a difficult problem. Since the arena is primarily an interior, there wasn't much we could do to alter its basic structure, so we concentrated on careful management of the interior shapes to create an iconic space. The building is essentially a box with big rectangular windows, contrasted by round elements (generators) in the center. To create depth and parallax, we added linear elements such as railings and cables. We used contrasting values of dark and light on the floor, with walkways to create an interesting value pattern. All these elements work together to draw the player's eye to the flag--which must always be the focal point of the arena."
